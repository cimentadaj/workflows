             family = "Vaughan",

Description: Managing both a 'parsnip' model and a preprocessor, such as a
    model formula or recipe from 'recipes', can often be challenging. The goal
    of 'workflows' is to streamline this process by bundling the model alongside
    the preprocessor, all within the same object.
